It seems especially recently I've come across more and more
_long-form_ texts (think: hour-long blog posts; free books; series of posts).
I especially like the ones that go into the very fine details of some niche topic
and maybe also ramble a bit about completely unrelated but
highly entertaining asides.
And while I will probably never have enough time to read them all,
I decided to at least collect some of them here for future reference.
I'll do my best to add summaries, and to update this list semi-regularly.
